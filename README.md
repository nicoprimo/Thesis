# Thesis-v2
This repository will take track of the coding of thesis related to asses the impact of flexible assets (smart water heaters) in a community fed by the national grid and ground mounted PV panels in Martim Longo, PT

The project contains:
- A program that simulate the production of a small photovoltaic solar system using the python library PVlib and meteorological data from Meteonorm
- 2 programs that filters the annual consumption data of a cluster of LV customers and a cluster of MV customers based in Portugal and get the cluster total consumption for 1 representative week in March, 1 week in June, 1 week in September and 1 week in December
- a program that simulate the consumption of a cluster of water heaters, given a hypothetical probability curve that represents the probability each water heater might be on during the day.
- a program that simulate the energy flows in the community with the water heater behaving "business as usual" vs charging in order to optimize the local consumption
